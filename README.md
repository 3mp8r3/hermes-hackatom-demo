# Hermes - Connecting IBC Enabled Blockchains Demo

## Introduction

In this demo we will be working with the [Hermes IBC Relayer](https://hermes.informal.systems) in order to transfer fungible tokens ([ics-020](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-020-fungible-token-transfer)) between two [Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport) custom chains.

This demo's primary goal is to better understand the IBC protocol and how packets are relayed from one chain to another using the IBC primitives (client, connections, channels, ports, and packets).
